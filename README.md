This project takes a .tex file and converts it to HTML. Just run:
```bash
docker pull latexml/ar5ivist
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 web/app.py
```
And then go to the link it takes you to and upload a tex file. This hasn't been thoroughly tested and is a basic PoC. I haven't actually tested the upload route because I'm not on my beefy computer with docker, so I hope it works.


# Requirements
Just install the requirements.txt and have docker installed and then run the above command.
